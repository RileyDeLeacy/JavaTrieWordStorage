# JavaTrieWordStorage
This program stores all words in an input text file, disregards all words (stop words) in another text file and is performs complex searches on the original text file.
Text files, some CDTs/ADTs and file structure were omitted so the code will not run. This is to be used only as an example of code structure and code practices.
